Description: ### Ventiliser
        
        Ventiliser is a tool for segmenting pressure and flow waveforms from ventilators into breaths. It also attempts to find the position of breath sub-phases. Ventiliser was developed on data from neonates ventialted on Draeger ventilators.
        
        Please see the accompanying paper ["Computational analysis of neonatal ventilator waveforms and loops"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-01301-9) for details
        
        ### Installation
        
        Ventiliser depends on numpy, pandas, scipy, atpbar, and PyQT5. Installation via pip is recommended.
        
        ```python
        pip install ventiliser
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        An example of a simple script can be seen below
        
        ```python
        from ventiliser.GeneralPipeline import GeneralPipeline
        
        pipeline = GeneralPipeline()
        pipeline.configure() # For information on parameters you can configure see docs
        pipeline.load_data("path to data", [0,1,2]) # [0,1,2] refers to the columns in your data file corresponding to time, pressure, flow
        pipeline.process() # You can suppress log and output files by setting them false. See docs for more information
        
        # To access the breaths programmatically you can do as follows
        pipeline.labeller.get_breaths_raw()
        # To access the pressure and state labels programmatically you can do as follows
        pipeline.mapper.p_labels
        pipeline.mapper.f_labels
        ```
        
        Please view the docs for more detailed information on optional parameters.
